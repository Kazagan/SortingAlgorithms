Repository where I plan to write sorting algorithms in C to help better understand them.

Int Comparisons are working now for equality, allowing me to assert on the arrays, so I can have a sort of unit test for the sorting library

Steps:
- [x] Assertion method to compare two arrays of x type
- [x] int comparer, should return negative if less, zero if equal, and positive if greater
- [x] string comparer, same as above, for each letter, returning at first character less or greater.
- [x] use Qsort to ensure my custom comparers are working as expected.
- [] Bubble sort ( First step, simple but slow )
