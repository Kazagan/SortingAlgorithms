Repository where I plan to write sorting algorithms in C to help better understand them.

All sorting algorithms are currenetly being done for arrays of x type. 
Possibly to get a better understanding I will stretch to also sort linked lists.

Steps:
- [x] Assertion method to compare two arrays of x type
- [x] int comparer, should return negative if less, zero if equal, and positive if greater
- [x] string comparer, same as above, for each letter, returning at first character less or greater.
- [x] use Qsort to ensure my custom comparers are working as expected.
- [x] Bubble sort ( First step, simple but slow )
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Merge sort ( Should return here to improve speed by replacing smaller array sortings with another sorting algorithm)
- [ ] quick sort ( pivot point undecided)
