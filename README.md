Repository where I plan to write sorting algorithms in C to help better understand them.

Int Comparisons are working now for equality, allowing me to assert on the arrays, so I can have a sort of unit test for the sorting library

Writing the string comparisons is working, except when figuring out how to incremement the char array but the correct number of characters after checking a work.
Need to figure out a solution.

current idea centers around possibly returning -1 when value is not equal, but size of word when they are, 
but am unsure how this would apply to future comparisons, when writing the actual sorting algorithms.
